# Java Yacht
Copyright Â© 2013 Bart Massey

This is an implementation of a classic "poker dice" game
called "Yacht" in Java. Yacht is taken from a game rulebook
(*Hoyle's Rules of Games,* ed. Alfred Morehead and Geofferey
Mott-Smith, New American Library 1948) that well predates
the introduction of the similar (and similarly-named) game
introduced in 1956.

I wrote this code in 1997, and haven't done much of anything
since. Still, it seems to work OK.

To compile it and run it, you'll need a couple of other
libraries, available on [my GitHub](http://github.com/BartMassey).
